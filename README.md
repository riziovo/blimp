Simple 2D game. Test your luck.

At the moment this is console based. I will come around to give it the GUI treatement with <b>JavaFX</b> in near future.

This is a 2D game idea I had. Consume the Golums. At each turn the Golums, at any given location, can only move to a finite set of locations. Predict and Move there to catch them.

GUI to be added in near future.
